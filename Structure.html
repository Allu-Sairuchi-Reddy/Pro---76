<p>The study of rockets is an excellent way for students to learn the basics of forces and the response of an object to external forces. In flight, a rocket is subjected to the forces of weight, thrust, and aerodynamics. On this slide, we have removed the outer "skin" so that we can see the parts that make a rocket. There are many parts that make up a rocket. For design and analysis, engineers group parts which have the same function into systems. There are four major systems in a full scale rocket; the structural system, the payload system, the guidance system, and the propulsion system.</p>
